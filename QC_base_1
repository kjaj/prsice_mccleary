# cleaning GWAS sumstats data in R - PRSice also needs an unzipped copy (you can delete this copy after analyses to save space)
# see https://choishingwan.github.io/PRS-Tutorial/base/

# note: base and target data need to be on the SAME GENOME BUILD. This needs to be checked with every PRS analysis

# note 2: sample overlap: there should be no overlapping people (people who are in the base GWAS and who are also in the target dataset)

# note you may need to install package R.utils to read .gz files, alternatively you can unzip the sumstats folder and save that unzipped copy in your directory, then read into R
